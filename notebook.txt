Initial shot. I'm planning to take glove vectors and implement k-means clustering and dimension reduction.

After that I will try and learn hamming distance bit-vectors for specific clusters

Results for baseline. 100k words, 95% training the rest asking for the closest word in the db

r@: 10, 100, 1000: 0.470705858828 0.76524695061 0.956808638272

BTW for 10k words, 50% training the results were:

r@: 10, 100, 1000: 0.683663267347 0.943411317736 0.998800239952

For 1k, 95% train r@10 is 0.764
